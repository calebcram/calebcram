### Hello World ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m an XR developer and Experienced Technician with a passion for Extended Reality and the seemingly infinite possibilities there are to be explored within the technology as innovation and capabilities grow. I have a B.S. in GIMM (Gaming Interactive Media and Mobile Technology) from Boise State University and I'm an XR software developer for the BSU NASA SUITS research team through which I have been exposed to Mixed Reality development combining VR, Hololens2 AR and traditional desktop software to create a seamless telepresence experience for enhanced communication.
